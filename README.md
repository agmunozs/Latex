# Latex
Some Latex and related scripts

The automatic letter of acceptance generation and email submission via command line using Perl required an adequate configuration of postfix (SMTP) and the required packages listed at the beginning of the Perl script.

Those packages can be easily downloaded and installed typing:

 perl -MCPAN -e shell

and then, in the Perl CPAN shell:

 install XX:YY
 
where XX:YY are the required Perl packages.
